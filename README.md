# IPL Player Management System 🏏

The **IPL Player Management System** is a Java-based application designed to manage player data for IPL teams. This project emphasizes understanding the **Collection Framework**, **layered architecture**, and **Java-MySQL integration**.

## Project Structure 🔧

The application follows a layered architecture, ensuring modularity and maintainability. It is divided into the following packages:

1. **entity**: Contains classes that represent the core data models, such as Player, Team, etc.
2. **service**: Implements the business logic of the application.
3. **dao**: Handles database operations and interactions with MySQL.
4. **controller**: Manages the flow of data between the user and the system.
5. **utility**: Includes utility classes for tasks such as database connection, input validation, etc.


## Features ✨

- **Player Management**: Add, update, delete, and search players.
- **Team Management**: Manage teams and assign players to teams.
- **Data Persistence**: Store and retrieve data using MySQL.
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns using DAO, service, and controller layers.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Utilizes Java Collection Framework for in-memory operations.


## Technologies Used  🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frameworks**: Java Collection Framework
- **IDE**: Eclipse 


## Folder Structure 📁

The project is organized into the following packages and classes:

```plaintext
